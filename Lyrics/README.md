# Lyrics

Here can you find scripts to get lyrics from an external lyrics provider.

Attach the script to the Lyrics trigger to fetch lyrics on demand. Only the first trigger will be executed.

At the moment there is no specific lyrics provider implemented. You can use the `lyrics_generic.lua` script as template to implement your own lyrics fetch script.
